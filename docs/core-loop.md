# **Hoost: The $1B Social Photo Sharing App**

---

## **‚ú® Product Vision**

Hoost is a mobile-first social platform that brings people together through **daily creative challenges**. By delivering a single unique challenge every day at **10:00 AM GMT**, Hoost creates a ritualized user experience centered around **creativity, anticipation, and community engagement**.

The vision for Hoost is to redefine how users interact with photo sharing apps:

- **Daily Creativity as a Habit**: Hoost transforms photo sharing into a purposeful and ritualistic experience.
- **Community-First Social Media**: By prioritizing friends' contributions and collective moments, Hoost promotes meaningful engagement.
- **Monetizable Authenticity**: The app capitalizes on user-generated creativity, anticipation-driven features, and premium experiences.
