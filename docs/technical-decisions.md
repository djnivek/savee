- **Trade-offs**: What we gain and what we lose

## Decisions

### 1. Network Client using a internal Swift Package

- **Decision**: Create a Swift package to handle network communication with the server
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Embedding network code directly in the app
  - Using a third-party networking library
  - Creating an internal framework
- **Rationale**: 
  - Easier to maintain and update independently of main app code
  - Reduces app binary size through dynamic framework approach
  - Enables code reuse across multiple apps
- **Consequences**:
  - Need to maintain separate package
  - Additional dependency management
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gain: Modularity, reusability, smaller app size
  - Lose: Some additional complexity in project setup and maintenance
